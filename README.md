formatReadme
============

Have you ever inherited code which has text files (like README, INSTALL) 
which are not formatted to fit the typical 80 character screen width? Well
fret no more. You have come to the right place. formatReadme takes a text 
file and formats it to fit in a 80 character screen. The usage is simple

```
./formatReadme <text file>
```

Eg.

```
./formatReadme README
```

The new formatted file - new-\{oldName\} - is created in the same directory as 
the old file. Please visually inspect the created file for sanity.
